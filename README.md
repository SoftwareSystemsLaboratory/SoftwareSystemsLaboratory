`A Loyola University Chicago CS Virtual Laboratory` 

## Methodology

We foster innovation by encouraging experimentation and collaboration with a strong emphasis on openness. To uphold this commitment, we enforce open-source software development, open access, and dissemination of research software by creating reproducible results within all of our projects.

SSL embraces the notion that diversity drives creativity and innovation. We follow the principles of the [IEEE Special Technical Community on Broadening Participation](http://stcbp.org/) allowing anyone regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, physical, mental, and cognitive ability, or LGBTQA+ status to join our lab.
